More information about the 2015 BMW 3 Series: The BMW 3-Series is a family of sporty sedans and wagons sized at what would be considered a compact car in the U.S. The 2015 BMW 3-Series Sedans and Sports Wagon models are built on a platform that made its debut with the 2012 model. Across its entire lineup, the 3-Series models stand out for being athletic, responsive and fun to drive, as well as more fuel-efficient than most other alternatives. The F30 redesign brought more back-seat space and cargo space to sedans, as well as a more sophisticated and isolated ride.
